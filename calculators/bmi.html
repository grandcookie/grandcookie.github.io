						<button class="accordion-btn">Does my gender affect my BMI reading?</button>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>Yes, your gender can influence how your BMI is interpreted, even though the calculation itself is the same for everyone. BMI is based solely on height and weight, and it does not account for differences in muscle mass, fat distribution, or body composition between males and females. Because of these differences, BMI should be considered alongside other health indicators rather than as a standalone measure.</p>
